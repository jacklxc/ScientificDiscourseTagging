the stimulatory effect of constitutively active raga on s6k phosphorylation was not dramatic in normal culture medium ( fig. 2 ) .	result
previously , we had also observed	result
that stimulation of s6k phosphorylation by rheb was not dramatic in rich medium but was greatly enhanced under nutrient poor conditions34 .	result
therefore , we tested s6k phosphorylation under amino acid deprivation .	method
co-expression of constitutively active raga q66l increased s6k phosphorylation	result
while wild type raga or dominant negative raga t21n did not ( fig. 3a ) .	result
moreover , expression of raga t21n and ragc q120l completely blocked s6k phosphorylation in response to amino acid stimulation ( fig. 3b ) .	result
surprisingly , expression of dominant negative ragc s75n but not constitutively active ragc q120l reproducibly increased s6k phosphorylation ( fig. 3a ) .	result
although the effect was less dramatic , given the low expression of ragc s75n	result
the s6k activation caused by ragc s75n was in fact rather significant .	result
transfection with as little as 20ng of raga q66l dna strongly increased s6k phosphorylation in the absence of amino acids and this effect lasted over 12hrs ( fig. s2a , data not shown ) .	result
expression of raga t21n strongly blocked amino acid stimulation	result
even though the expression level was low ( fig. s2a ) .	result

rho-like gtpases , including cdc42 , rac , and rho , regulate	fact
signaling pathways that control actin cytoskeletal structures and transcriptional activation .	fact
the tiam1 gene encodes an activator of rac1 , and similarly to constitutively activated ( v12 ) rac1	fact
overexpression of tiam1 in fibroblasts induces the formation of membrane ruffles .	fact
tiam1 contains a dbl homology ( dh ) domain and adjacent pleckstrin homology ( ph ) domain , hallmarks for activators of rho-like gtpases .	fact
unique for tiam1 are an additional ph domain and a discs-large homology region in the nh2-terminal part of the protein .	fact
here we show	result
that both in fibroblasts and cos cells , membrane localization of tiam1 is required for the induction of membrane ruffling .	result
a detailed mutational analysis , in combination with confocal laser scanning microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy , demonstrates	method
that the nh2-terminal ph domain of tiam1 , but not the dh-adjacent ph domain , is essential for membrane association .	result
this nh2-terminal ph domain of tiam1 can be functionally replaced by the myristoylated membrane localization domain of c-src ,	result
indicating that the primary function of this ph domain is to localize the protein at the membrane .	implication
after serum starvation , both membrane association of tiam1 and ruffling can be induced by serum ,	result
suggesting that receptor stimulation induces membrane translocation of tiam1 .	implication
similar to v12rac1	result
tiam1 stimulates the activity of the c-jun nh2-terminal kinase ( jnk ) .	result
this rac-dependent stimulation of jnk also requires membrane association of tiam1 .	result
we conclude	implication
that the regulated membrane localization of tiam1 through its nh2-terminal ph domain determines the activation of distinct rac-mediated signaling pathways .	implication

while most wnt signaling has been attributed to the activation of fz receptors	fact
an alternative possibility is that wnts carry out their diverse roles by signaling via different receptors .	hypothesis
one such receptor is ror2 , an orphan tyrosine kinase possessing an extracellular cysteine-rich wnt binding domain ( crd ) [ 20 - 23 ] .	fact
wnt5a and mror2 have overlapping expression patterns , their knockout phenotypes are similar , and recently	result
mror2 has been shown to act synergistically with wnt5a to activate jun kinase [ 23 - 26 ] .	result
thus , wnt5a may be mediating its inhibitory role through the activation of this novel receptor .	hypothesis

first , in pex14delta and pex5delta/pex14delta strains , pex13p still coimmunoprecipitated with mycpex7p ( fig. 3 ) ,	result
suggesting that pex13p associates directly or indirectly with pex7p .	implication
moreover , this result indicated	result
that neither pex14p nor pex5p is required for the formation of this subcomplex of pex13p and pex7p .	implication
second , the amount of pex5p in the precipitate from pex14delta cells was drastically reduced ,	result
while the amount in pex13p remained essentially unchanged ( fig. 3 , lane pex14delta ) .	result
this result supports the notion	implication
that the amount of pex5p bound to pex13p does not determine the stoichiometry of the pex13p-pex7p subcomplex .	implication
however , it also suggests	implication
that pex13p may not bind both import receptors equally at the same time .	implication
third , pex13p , pex14p , and pex5p still coimmunoprecipitated with pex7p in pex17delta cells ( fig. 3 , lane pex17delta ) .	result
obviously , pex7p is associated with components of the peroxisomal translocation machinery in the absence of pex17p ,	result
suggesting that the presence of pex17p is not a prerequisite for docking of pex7p to the peroxisomal membrane .	implication
fourth , the lack of pex17p in the coimmunoprecipitate from pex14delta cells ( fig. 3 , lane pex14delta ) , suggests	result
that pex14p is required for the association of pex17p with the complex , and is consistent with the assumption that pex17p binding to the complex may be via pex14p .	implication
however , this observation must be interpreted with care	problem
since the pex14delta cells contain much less immunologically detectable pex17p ( huhse et al. , 1998 ) .	problem
finally , the amount of fox3p	result
that coimmunoprecipitates with pex7p drastically increases in mutants with an import defect for pts2 proteins ( pex17delta , pex13delta , pex14delta , and pex5delta/pex14delta ) relative to the strains unaffected in this pathway ( wild-type and pex5delta ) .	result
since the total amount of both proteins is similar in all strains ( fig. 3 b ) , it seems unlikely	result
that the observed pex7p/fox3p complex has formed in vitro after cell disruption .	hypothesis
a simple explanation for this may be	implication
that the high cytosolic concentration of thiolase in the import mutants results in greater occupation of the pts2 receptor .	implication

in the later part of the study , we employed	method
a linear ion trap fourier transform mass spectrometer ( ltq-ft , thermofinnigan ) .	method
this instrument has significantly higher	fact
sequencing speed and peptide mass accuracy , which resulted in significantly higher quality data .	fact

lc3 , the mammalian atg8 homolog , undergoes a set of modifications resulting in conversion from lc3i to lc3ii during autophagy 42 .	fact
to further test the function of rag in autophagy	goal
we examined the lc3 modification in hek293 cells .	method
expression of raga ql and ragc sn inhibited lc3 conversion in response to amino acid starvation ( fig. 7e ) .	result
furthermore , expression of raga tn and ragc ql enhanced lc3 conversion even in the presence of amino acids .	result
these results are consistent with the data observed in drosophila and further demonstrate a role of the rag gtpases in autophagy regulation in response to nutrient signals .	implication

after stimulation , cells were lysed in np-40 lysis buffer ( 20 mm hepes , ph 7.5 , 150 mm nacl , 1 % np-40 , and 1 mm na3vo4 )	method
containing edta-free complete protease inhibitor cocktail ( boehringer mannheim corp. , indianapolis , in ) , centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 min , and precleared twice with 50 mul of gammabind g-sepharose slurry ( pharmacia biotech , piscataway , nj ) .	method
map kinases were immunoprecipitated with 50 mul gammabind g-sepharose slurry and 2 mug polyclonal rabbit antibody , specific for the 20 cooh-terminal residues of p38alpha or the 17 cooh-terminal residues of jnk1 ( santa cruz biotechnology , santa cruz , ca ) .	method
immunoprecipitates were washed twice with np-40 lysis buffer and twice with kinase reaction buffer ( 25 mm hepes , ph 7.5 , 10 mm mgcl2 , 10 mm mncl2 , 20 mm beta-glycerophosphate , and 1x edta-free complete protease inhibitor cocktail ) .	method
kinase reactions were performed for 20 min at 30degreesc in kinase reaction buffer	method
containing 50 mum atp and 5 muci gamma- [ 32p ] atp ( 3,000 ci/mmol ; amersham corp. , arlington heights , il ) with 0.5 mug gst-map kinase - activated protein kinase 2 ( mapkapk2 ; upstate biotechnology , lake placid , ny ) as p38 substrate or 2 mug gst-c-jun ( biomol , king of prussia , pa ) as jnk1 substrate .	method
samples were boiled in sds sample buffer , electrophoresed in 10 % tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels , and transferred to pvdf membranes ( novex , san diego , ca ) .	method
bands were quantified on a phosphorimager system ( storm 840 ; molecular dynamics inc. , sunnyvale , ca ) .	method
membranes were stained for p38 and jnk1 protein	method
using the p38 and jnk1 antibodies described above and the vistra ecf western blotting system ( amersham corp. ) .	method

to investigate whether ampk mediates vegf-stimulated no synthesis	goal
we first determined the effects of physiological concentrations of vegf on ampk activity and enos ser1177 phosphorylation in haecs .	method
vegf ( 10 ng/ml ) elicited a transient , concomitant activation of ampk and enos phosphorylation at ser1177 ,	result
which reached a maximum 2.8 - and 3.6-fold stimulation , respectively , after 5 min .	result
both ampk activity and enos phosphorylation rapidly returned to basal levels ( fig. 1a ) .	result
in addition , activation of ampk and phosphorylation of enos at ser1177 by vegf shared	result
a similar dose-dependence , such that ampk activity and enos ser1177 phosphorylation were stimulated maximally ( 2.5 - and 3.6-fold , respectively ) by 10 ng/ml vegf , a concentration at which all further experiments were performed ( fig. 1b ) .	result
previous studies have reported	result
that stimulation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( huvecs ) with vegf for 6 h or bovine aortic endothelial cells ( baecs ) with vegf for 10 min was without effect on phosphorylation of ampk at thr172 [ 15,19 ] .	result
these studies are in agreement with the present study	result
in which vegf-stimulated ampk activity peaked after 5 min incubation and returned to basal values within 15 min .	result

immunoprecipitations were performed	method
as described previously 38 using postnuclear supernatants of 1 % detergent ( triton x-100 , np-40 , or laurylmaltoside [ n-dodecyl beta-d-maltoside ; sigma-aldrich ] ) cell lysates ( lysis buffer : tris-buffered saline , ph 7.5 , containing 1 mm pefabloc , 10 mm edta , 10 mm naf , 1 mm navo3 ) and cnbr sepharose beads ( amersham pharmacia biotech ) coupled with protein a-purified mabs .	method
precipitations using recombinant glutathione s-transferase ( gst ) -coupled src homology ( sh ) 2 domains	method
were performed as described elsewhere 3238 .	method
the sh2 domains of csk , vav , and ras-gap were provided by dr. a. beyers ( university of stellenbosch medical school , tygerberg , south africa ) .	method
all other sh2 domains have been described elsewhere 3238 .	result
precipitates were washed and then either subjected to sds-page or further processed for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis , in vitro kinase assay , or reprecipitation experiments .	method
gems were immunoprecipitated from raji and jurkat cells by the " solid phase immunoisolation technique " followed by in vitro kinase assays ,	method
as described previously 9 . reprecipitation experiments were conducted as described elsewhere 3738 .	method
in some experiments , immunoisolation was performed	method
using minicolumns ( 25-200-mul packed volume ) of cnbr sepharose beads coupled with protein a-purified mabs .	method
postnuclear lysates were passed through the columns .	method
after washing with 10-column volumes of lysis buffer ,	method
bound proteins were eluted with 2-column volumes of 2 % sds and the flow-through , and eluted fractions were analyzed by sds-page followed by western blotting .	method

grb2 was also found to bind sequences	result
that deviate from the strict target sequence py-x-n .	result
our experiments suggest the more generalized consensus motif py- [ phiq ] - [ nqfdk ] ,	implication
where phi is a hydrophobic residue .	implication
binding of grb2 to motifs deviating from the py-x-n sequence has previously been noted ( songyang et al , 1994 ; ward et al , 1996 ) .	result
to describe grb2 binding preferences	goal
we compared ion intensities in extracted ion chromatograms of identical tryptic peptides of grb2 from pull-down experiments with different phosphotyrosine residues ( figure 3 ) .	method
for the same mass spectrometric conditions , peptide ion signals from the same tryptic peptide in different experiments are indicative of the abundance of these peptides in different samples , a fact	method
that is , for example , used in protein correlation profiling ( andersen et al , 2003 ) .	method
those bait peptides	method
containing an asparagine residue at position +2 led to identification of grb2 peptides with high ion intensities .	method
this correlates with the strong binding of grb2 to the py-x-n motif .	method
in contrast , bait peptides without asparagine at position +2 resulted in the identification of tryptic peptides with significantly lower ion intensities ( figure 3 ) .	result
nevertheless ,	result
in all cases , grb2 was identified as a specific binding partner to the bait peptide , and these results were confirmed by western blots ( insets in figure 3 ) .	result
furthermore , our findings are in agreement with in vitro studies of binding affinities of synthetic peptides to the recombinant sh2 domain of grb2 ( ward et al , 1996 ) .	implication

to investigate whether ck2 phosphorylation of the mdc1 sdtd region promotes mrn binding in vivo , we transiently expressed	goal
a haemagglutinin ( ha ) -tagged mdc1 sdtd fragment coupled to a nuclear localization sequence in u20s cells ( ha-sdtd6 ; supplementary fig s1c online ) .	method
immunoblotting showed	result
that treating these cells with the ck2 inhibitor 4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-benzimidazole increased the electrophoretic mobility of the mdc1 sdtd fragment and reduced the ability of the fragment to co-immunoprecipitate mrn ( fig 2e ) .	result

acc is phosphorylated by ampk at ser80 in acc1 and ser220 in acc2 ( human sequence ) .	fact
using an antibody that recognises both phosphorylated species , we demonstrated that vegf stimulates phosphorylation of acc	result
an effect completely inhibited in haecs infected with ad.alpha1dn ( fig. 4 ) .	result
these data indicate	result
that infection with ad.alpha1dn completely inhibits vegf-stimulated ampk activity .	result
we were unable	result
to distinguish whether the band represented acc1 , acc2 or both .	result
inhibition of acc1/acc2 by phosphorylation at ser80/ser221 has been demonstrated	result
to inhibit fatty acid synthesis in adipose tissue and liver whilst stimulating fatty acid oxidation in heart and skeletal muscle [ 11 ] .	result
activation of ampk with aicar has been shown to stimulate fatty acid oxidation in huvecs [ 23 ] , so	result
it remains possible that vegf transiently stimulates fatty acid oxidation due to ampk-mediated phosphorylation of acc .	hypothesis

we next assayed	hypothesis
whether mror2 was carrying out its inhibitory function through direct binding to wnt5a .	hypothesis
two variants of the extracellular cysteine-rich wnt binding domain ( crd ) of mror2 were cloned in frame amino-terminal to an immunoglobulin heavy chain domain ( igg )	method
as previously described and expressed in 293 cells [ 43 ] .	method
one variant is comprised of the ror2 crd alone cloned downstream of an exogenous signal sequence ( ror2 crd-igg ) ;	method
the other variant utilizes the endogenous ror2 signal sequence and possesses the full amino terminus of the ror2 protein ending at the carboxyl terminus of the crd ( ror2 nt crd-igg ) .	method
the secreted mror2 crd-igg fusion proteins were then purified from conditioned media , bound	method
to protein a beads , and tested for their ability to bind to purified wnt proteins .	method
the smoothened receptor is a fz family member that possesses a crd domain but ,	fact
rather than playing a role in wnt signaling , it functions exclusively hedgehog signal transmission .	fact
as a negative control , purified smoothened ( smo ) crd-igg protein was also bound to beads and assayed for wnt binding .	method
figure 5b shows	result
that wnt5a protein specifically binds to the purified ror2 and fz4 crd domains , whereas only background binding to the smoothened crd occurs .	result
wnt3a protein shows specific binding only to the fz4 crd-igg protein ( unpublished data ) .	result

it has not been shown	problem
whether ptp-pest binds directly to pstpip , but peptides derived from the conserved proline-rich cooh terminus of ptp-pest can compete the binding of ptp-hscf to pstpip ( spencer et al. , 1997 ) , consistent with the suggestion that ptp-pest binds to pstpip in a manner similar to ptp-hscf binding .	result
in addition , while no previous data had shown that ptp-pest can dephosphorylate pstpip , the fact that pstpip is hyperphosphorylated in the ptp-pest ( -/- ) cells ( fig. 7 ) strongly suggests	result
that ptp-pest plays a direct role in modulating the tyrosine phosphorylation level of pstpip .	implication
ptp-hscf and another member of the pest family , ptp-pep , are generally not expressed in fibroblasts , and	result
it is possible that ptp-pest regulates pstpip in fibroblasts the way ptp-hscf does in hematopoietic cells .	hypothesis
the exact site that is hyperphosphorylated on pstpip in ptp-pest ( -/- ) cells is not known , and	problem
the effects of this hyperphosphorylation on binding , for example , to wasp ( wu et al. , 1998b ) are still under investigation .	problem
one of the observable effects appears	result
to be an increase in the relative amount of cells found in the last stages of cytokinesis in a field of unsynchronized cells ( fig. 8 ) , possibly due to the role of pstpip in cleavage furrow assembly or disassembly .	result
it is also possible	hypothesis
that the increase of pstpip tyrosine phosphorylation is the result , and not the cause , of the increase of the number of cells in this phase .	hypothesis

immunoprecipitation and coimmunoprecipitation were performed as described ( fazioli et al. , 1993 ) .	method
briefly , cells were lysed on ice with buffer containing 1 % triton x-100 , 50 mm hepes ( ph 7.5 ) , 150 mm nacl , 5 mm egta , 1.5 mm mgcl2 , 10 % glycerol , 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate , 2 mm phenylmethylphosphate fluoride , 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate 10 mug/ml aprotinin , and 10 mug/ml leupeptin .	method
immunoprecipitations were performed for 2 h at 4degreesc , and	method
immunocomplexes were recovered by adsorption to protein a-sepharose .	method
after	method
several washes with buffer containing 0.1 % triton x-100 , 20 mm hepes ( ph 7.6 ) , 10 % glycerol , and 150 mm nacl ( washing buffer ) , immunoprecipiates were resolved be sds-page and analyzed by immunoblotting .	method

aly/+ , aly/aly , and c57bl/6j mice were purchased from clea japan .	method
the mice were maintained under pathogen-free conditions and were handled in accordance with the guidelines for animal experimentation of tokushima university school of medicine .	method

ikkalpha-deficient mice were generated by gene	method
targeting as described previously and maintained at osaka university 11 .	method

the nature of the association of trf2 with atm was explored further	goal
using in vitro pulldown experiments .	method
gst-tagged fragments of atm were tested for their ability to bind purified trf2 protein expressed in a baculovirus system .	method
in parallel , we used baculovirus-derived trf1 ,	method
which was previously shown to interact with atm by co-ip ( kishi et al. 2001 ) .	method
trf2 bound to two overlapping fragments of atm spanning amino acids 1439 to 2138 ( figure 4b ) .	result
this region contains the fat domain and s1981 , the critical target of autophosphorylation ( bakkenist and kastan 2003 ) .	fact
trf1 bound a different region of atm ( figure 4b ) ,	result
demonstrating the specificity of the observed interactions .	result

to examine further the nbs1 recruitment defect of cells expressing mdc1sdtddelta	goal
we used the ' laser scissors ' technique to generate dna dsbs along defined sub-micrometre tracks in live cells ( limoli & ward , 1993 ) .	method
in mdc1wt-expressing cells , the extent of nbs1 recruitment closely resembled that of mdc1 ( fig 4ea ) .	result
by contrast ,	result
although mdc1sdtddelta recruitment was indistinguishable from that of the mdc1wt protein , the nbs1 recruitment pattern was altered .	result
thus ,	implication
in mdc1sdtddelta cells , although nbs1 was recruited to the laser path , its pattern no longer resembled the broad distribution of mdc1 ; instead , nbs1 was restricted to a discrete micro-focal pattern lying within the broader track of mdc1 staining ( fig 4eb ) .	implication
this indicates	implication
that sdtd phosphorylation of mdc1 is required to retain nbs1 on gammah2ax-coupled chromatin , but that nbs1 might recognize other structures induced by laser microirradiation independently of mdc1 .	implication
consistent with these results , and in line with our finding that the fha domain of nbs1 is required for mdc1 sdtd binding	implication
similar micro-focal patterns of nbs1 recruitment were observed in mdc1-depleted cells and in cells in which the fha domain of nbs1 was mutated ( lukas et al , 2004 ) .	result

dishes of cells were washed with pbs supplemented with 1 mm of sodium vanadate , harvested , lysed , and evaluated for protein content using the bio-rad protein assay .	method
for immunoprecipitations of paxillin and cortactin , cells were lysed in ripa buffer ( 50 mm tris-hcl , ph 7.2 , 150 mm nacl , 0.1 % sds , 0.5 % sodium deoxycholate , 1 % nonidet p-40 ) .	method
for fak , pstpip , and pstpip2 immunoprecipitations , cells were lysed by sonication in hnmetg ( 50 mm hepes , ph 7.5 , 150 mm nacl , 1.5 mm mgcl2 , 1 mm egta , 1 % triton x-100 , 10 % glycerol ) .	method
for vinculin and p130cas , the lysis buffer used was tne buffer ( 10 mm tris hcl , ph 7.5 , 1 mm edta , 150 mm nacl , 1 % nonidet p-40 ) .	method
lysis buffers were supplemented with 1 mm of sodium vanadate and complete ( tm ) protease inhibitor mixture ( boehringer mannheim gmbh ) .	method

total f-actin fiber length was calculated after	method
digitalizing tritc-phalloidin stained f-actin by using the metamorph image processing software .	method
the edges of the cells were detected by the aid of a convolution kernel	method
comparing the brightness of the neighboring pixels .	method
after	method
thresholding and separating from the background specimen , fiber lengths were determined and expressed as the percentage of the mean fiber length compared with the fiber length of mock-transfected fibroblasts .	method

a more quantitative assay for migration is the chamber mobility assay ,	method
where the ability of cells to translocate to the fibronectin-coated side of a perforated membrane is measured ( see materials and methods ) .	method
once again , we compared the migration of ptp-pest ( +/- ) and ptp-pest ( -/- ) cells .	method
as in the wound-healing assay , a significant decrease in motility was observed in the knockout cells ( fig. 2 e ) .	result
to ensure that this effect is indeed due to the absence of ptp-pest	goal
ptp-pest ( -/- ) cells were transfected with ptp-pest and a stably overexpressing clone was obtained .	method
when tested in the same assay , these cells showed an increase in migration	result
that was significant but still not comparable with wild-type levels .	result
one possibility is	hypothesis
that overexpression of ptp-pest could also have deleterious effects on cell migration , as is the case with ptp1b ( liu et al. , 1998 ) .	hypothesis
to test this hypothesis , we are currently trying	goal
to obtain clones expressing more physiological levels of ptp-pest , as well as different constructs and catalytically inactive mutants of the phosphatase , and verify the effects on this phenotype and the others described below .	method

to investigate whether membrane association of tiam1 is also required for the induction of other rac-mediated signaling pathways besides membrane ruffling	goal
the activity of jnk was determined after cotransfection with different tiam1 mutants ( see materials and methods ) .	method
both in cos-7 cells and nih3t3 cells , cotransfection of fulllength tiam1 led to an almost sevenfold stimulation of jnk activity , similar to constitutively activated ( v12 ) rac1 ( fig. 9 a ) .	result
cotransfection of tagged mitogen-activated protein kinase ( mapk ) with full-length or mutant tiam1 or ( v12 ) rac did not result in activation of mapk ( not shown ) .	result
the stimulation of jnk by tiam1 was dependent on the activation of rac ,	result
since cotransfection of dominantnegative ( n17 ) rac1 partly blocked the activation of jnk by tiam1 ( fig. 9 a ) .	result
higher amounts of ( n17 ) rac interfered with the expression of jnk .	result
furthermore , a deletion in the catalytic dh domain of tiam1 prevented jnk activation ( not shown ) .	result
cotransfection of dominant-negative ( n17 ) cdc42 did not interfere with the activation of jnk by tiam1 ( data not shown ) .	result
transfection of c1199 tiam1 stimulated jnk activity to a similar extent as fl1591 ( fig. 9 b ) .	result
however , shorter cooh-terminal tiam1 fragments such as c682 and c580 tiam1 ,	result
which did not localize to the plasma membrane , were not able to activate jnk above background levels .	result
also , mutant c1199-deltaphn tiam1 ,	result
which did not localize to the plasma membrane because of the deletion in the nh2-terminal ph domain , was unable to activate jnk ( fig. 9 b ) .	result
ms-c580 tiam1 caused no stimulation of jnk activity ( fig. 9 b ) , and	result
neither did ms-c1199-deltaphn or ms-fl1591-deltaphn tiam1 proteins ( data not shown ) .	result
these proteins , however , induced membrane ruffling and were present at the plasma membrane ( fig. 6 ) .	result
a possible explanation for this somewhat unexpected result is	implication
that activation of endogenous rac by ms-containing tiam1 proteins is sufficient for induction of membrane ruffling but not for stimulation of jnk .	implication
alternatively , the lack of induction of jnk activity is caused by the different ultrastructural localization of the ms-c580 tiam1 protein	hypothesis
compare figs. 5 and 7 ) or may reflect the need for an intact nh2-terminal ph domain .	hypothesis
interestingly , similar results were obtained with membrane-targeted p110 phosphoinositide-3-kinase	result
which was able to stimulate membrane ruffling but not gene transcription from the jun-inducible fos promoter ( reif et al. , 1996 ) .	result
whatever the mechanism , these results indicate	implication
that the localization of tiam1 at the plasma membrane is also required for rac-mediated stimulation of jnk activity .	implication

since proper response to nutrient limitation is also important for organisms to survive under unfavorable conditions 43 , 44	fact
we investigated the effect of draga activity on adult animal viability in response to starvation .	method
targeted expression of constitutively active draga q61l to the fat body had no significant effect on survival in animals given a normal diet , but resulted in a significantly accelerated rate of death under starvation conditions ( fig. 8a , b ) .	result
in contrast , animals expressing the dominant negative draga t16n were more resistant to death induced by starvation .	result
similar effects on starvation survival were observed with ubiquitous expression of draga transgenes ( data not shown ) .	result
taken together these data suggest	implication
that the activity of draga is important for signaling in response to nutrient starvation and also is critical for animal survival .	implication

as shown in fig. 1 d , the pkc-specific inhibitor gf109203x ( toullec et al. , 1991 ) is capable of	result
reversing the dissolution of actin stress fibers by ras .	result
this effect is observed in the presence of 6 mum of the inhibitor ( fig. 1 d ) .	result
200 nm of the compound	result
which had been shown to be sufficient for blocking c - and n-type pkc isotype kinase activity in cell-free extracts ( fig. 2 a ) ( uberall et al. , 1997 ) , is , however , without an effect on the ras-mediated stress fiber dissolution ( fig. 1 c ) .	result
6 mum gf109203x corresponds roughly to the ic50 of the compound against	result
the atypical pkc-zeta ( fig. 2 b , see also martiny-baron et al. , 1993 ) , and as shown in fig. 2 c , exerts a similar effect on pkc-lambda , suggesting that if a pkc is involved in the ras-induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton , it should be an atypical ( a- ) , rather than a conventional ( c- ) or novel ( n- ) type pkc isoform .	result

cells were plated on fibronectin-coated slides ( described above ) for 20 min or 3 h .	method
they were then fixed 20 min with 4 % ( wt/vol ) pfa in pbs , and permeabilized with 0.1 % ( vol/vol ) triton x-100 in 4 % pfa for another 20 min .	method
the slides were blocked with 1 % ( wt/vol ) bsa in pbs for 20 min .	method
the cells were then incubated with the antivinculin antibody ( 1 : 400 dilution in pbs ) for 1 h at room temperature , washed three times with pbs , and stained with a mixture of fitc-conjugated anti-mouse antibody ( 1:200 ) and 4 mul/well of tritc-conjugated phalloidin ( molecular probes inc. ) .	method
after	method
being washed three times with pbs , the coverslips were mounted in a 1:1 mixture of glycerol and 2.5 % 1,4-diazabicyclo [ 2.2.2 ] octane ( dabco ; sigma chemical co. ) in pbs .	method
the cells were visualized with a nikon fluorescence microscope .	method
the number of focal adhesions in each cell was evaluated from photographs of the vinculin staining .	method

we also investigated the functional relationship between rag and rheb in vivo through genetic studies in drosophila .	goal
to test whether dragc is required for rheb to stimulate cell growth	goal
the effect of rheb overexpression on fat body cell size was examined in dragc-/ - cells .	method
mutation of dragc did not block the growth stimulatory effect of rheb overexpression ( fig. 6a , b ) .	result
in fact , rheb overexpression induced a greater relative cell size increase in a dragc-/ - genetic background .	result
similarly , rheb overexpression has been shown to have a stronger effect on cell size under starvation conditions38 ,	result
further suggesting that nutrient signaling is impaired in dragc mutants .	implication
we also examined the effect of rheb loss of function under conditions of draga q61l activation , and found	method
that rheb mutant cells were smaller than neighboring wild type cells both in control animals and in animals ubiquitously expressing draga q61l throughout the fat body ( fig 6c , d ) .	result
these data indicate	implication
that draga and dragc are not required for rheb to stimulate cell growth .	implication
we also found	result
that the increase in cell size in response to draga q61l expression was partially or completely suppressed in two different rheb hypomorphic mutant backgrounds ( data not shown ) , indicating that rheb activity may be required for the growth effects of draga .	result
together , these data suggest	implication
that rag acts parallel or upstream of rheb to stimulate cell growth .	implication

activation of atm also takes	fact
place in response to telomere damage .	fact
when telomeres become uncapped due to inhibition of trf2	fact
s1981-phosphorylated atm associates with telomeres ( takai et al. 2003 ) .	fact
furthermore , atm targets become phosphorylated in aging cells with shortened telomeres ( d'adda di fagagna et al. 2003 ) .	fact
genetic evidence for a role of atm in the telomere damage pathway is provided by the diminished ability of ataxia telangiectasia ( a-t ) cells	result
to mount a dna damage response after telomere uncapping ( karlseder et al. 1999 ; takai et al. 2003 ) .	result
however , several lines of evidence suggest	implication
that a second pikk ( phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like kinase ) , such as atr or dna-pkcs , can transduce the telomere damage signal in the absence of atm ( takai et al. 2003 ; wong et al. 2003 ) .	implication

there are conflicting data in the literature regarding the mechanism	problem
by which wnt5a and other so-called noncanonical wnt protein signals .	problem
to understand how signals like wnts influence cells	goal
one must discriminate between early and late effects and measure those effects in a concentration-dependent manner .	method
to that end , we have purified active wnt5a protein and established quantitative assays for	method
signaling .	method
we show for the first time	result
that soluble wnt5a protein is able to directly inhibit canonical wnt signaling .	result
treatment of cells with purified protein over short time intervals is sufficient	result
to inhibit the activation of the tcf/lef-driven luciferase reporter supertopflash ( stf ) .	result
the inhibition observed	result
is dose responsive , occurs downstream of beta-catenin stabilization , and is ptx insensitive .	result
we also show	implication
that an alternative wnt receptor , ror2 , is required for wnt5a-mediated inhibition of canonical signaling and that the extracellular , cysteine-rich wnt binding domain and intracellular , cytoplasmic domain are crucial for the receptor 's inhibitory function .	implication
whereas wnt5a protein is usually associated with noncanonical wnt signaling , we show	fact
that wnt5a can activate wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the presence of fz 4 and lrp5 .	result
based on these and other observations , we propose a model wherein receptor context dictates wnt signaling output ,	hypothesis
suggesting a new layer of regulatory complexity in the wnt signaling cascade with important implications in development and disease .	problem

african green monkey kidney fibroblasts ( cos-1 , 106/100-mm dish ) were transfected with 15 mug of circular plasmid dna per dish by lipofectin reagents ,	method
as described by the manufacturer .	method
48 h posttransfection , cells were lysed in 1 ml lysis buffer ( 150 mm nacl , 20 mm n-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-n'-2-ethanesulfonic acid [ hepes , ph 7.59 ] , 1 % nonidet p-40 ( vol/ vol ) , 50 mug/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin , and 1 mm phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride ) .	method
lysates were purified by using a ni2+-resin batch procedure , and	method
equal amounts of recombinant pkc isotypes were subjected to an enzymatic pkc assay as described elsewhere ( baier-bitterlich et al. , 1996 ; uberall et al. , 1997 ; kampfer et al. , 1998 ) .	method
enzyme activities of recombinant pkc-isotypes alpha , lambda , and zeta are expressed as cofactor-dependent phosphorylation of the [ a25s ] synthetic pkc peptide ( rfarkgslrqknvy ; presenting the pseudosubstrate sequence of pkc-alpha with an alanine to serine substitution ) .	method
the concentrations of substrate peptide and cofactors used are : 50 mug/ml [ a25s ] , 280 mug/ml ptdser , 10 mum tpa , and 1 mm cacl2 .	method
expression of the fusion tag peptide cooh-terminal of pkc-alpha and pkc-lambda	result

finally , some proteins have previously been reported	result
to interact with egfr ( van delfi et al , 1997 ) , such as eps15 ( schumacher et al , 1995 ) .	result
in our study , we see eps15 in pull-downs with a number of bait peptides , but always with a ratio of one to one , indicating no direct binding to the bait peptides .	result
this would in any case be expected	implication
since eps15 has no sh2 or ptb domain , and rather is recruited to egfr in a larger protein complex .	result

we intended	goal
to evaluate the role of nik in tnfr-i and ltbetar signaling with the use of in vivo mouse models , rather than introducing enforced gene-expression systems .	goal
to this end , we transfected efs ( which express both tnfr-i and ltbetar ) only with a reporter plasmid	method
that has three repeats of the nf-kappab site upstream of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter and a luciferase gene , and then stimulated the transfected efs with tnf or agonistic anti-ltbetar mab ( ac.h6 ) .	method
efs from both wild-type and aly mice showed upregulation of luciferase activity in response to human tnf	result
fig. 2 a ) .	result
the normal level of tnf responsiveness in aly mice is consistent with the results shown above ( fig. 1 ) .	result
in contrast to tnf stimulation , nf-kappab activation in response to agonistic anti-ltbetar mab was significantly reduced in aly mouse efs ,	result
indicating that nik is involved in ltbetar signaling ( fig. 2 a ) .	implication

we previously reported	result
that mitogenic stimulation of resting ccl39 cells led to a rapid nuclear translocation of mapks into the nucleus ( 27 ) .	result
translocation into the nucleus correlated nicely with the persistent activation of mapk during the g1 phase of the cell cycle .	result
for example , serum or alpha-thrombin , two potent mitogens of ccl39 cells , induced persistent mapk activation and nuclear localization .	result
in contrast , the thrombin receptor peptide activator or tpa , which transiently activates mapk , failed	result
to induce nuclear translocation of mapk ( 27 ) .	result
this result led	hypothesis
us to postulate that the p42/p44 mapk cascade itself controls the nuclear translocation of mapk .	hypothesis
therefore , we tested	method
whether addition of the specific mek inhibitor pd 98059 ( 12 ) was sufficient to block the entry of p42/p44 mapk in the nucleus in response to serum .	method
this inhibitor has been previously shown	result
to inhibit by up to 90 % mapk activation without affecting the activation of other mapk cascades , such as the jnk and p38 mapk pathways ( 2 ) .	result
in accordance to our and others ' previous observations , p42/p44 mapk immunostaining is predominantly cytoplasmic in serum-deprived cells ( fig. 1 a ) and in cells treated by the mek inhibitor pd 98059 alone ( fig. 1 d ) ,	result
whereas within 3 h of stimulation by 10 % fcs , it is relocated markedly in the nucleus ( fig. 1 b ) .	result
as depicted in fig. 1 c , the addition of the mek inhibitor pd 98059 ( 30 mum ) at the time of serum addition was sufficient	result
to block nuclear translocation of p42/p44 mapk .	result
as was reported by alessi et al. ( 2 ) we found	result
that mapk activity was not totally inhibited by 30 mum of pd 98059 compound in ccl39 cells ( up to 80 % inhibition ) .	result
this incomplete inhibition could explain	hypothesis
why in certain cells some nuclear localization of p42/p44 mapk remained .	hypothesis
in these cells it is possible	hypothesis
that mapk stimulation by serum may be extremely potent .	hypothesis
however , this result indicates	implication
that activation of the p42/p44 mapk signaling cascade in response to serum is absolutely required for nuclear translocation of p42/p44 mapk .	implication

one day prior to transfection , approximately 5 106 293t cells were plated in 10-cm dishes .	method
cells were transfected with 1 mug of flag-atm dna ( canman et al. 1998 ) and 9 mug of n-terminally myc-tagged trf2 ( karlseder et al. 2002 ) or trf1 in a plpc vector backbone ( gift of s. lowe , cold spring harbor laboratory ) or vector alone using capo4 coprecipitation .	method
two days after transfection , cells were harvested in media and divided into three equal fractions ,	method
which were exposed to 0 , 0.3 , or 0.6 gy ir .	method
cells were allowed	method
to recover for 30 min , washed with pbs , and resuspended in 250 mul of lysis buffer ( 50 mm tris [ ph 7.4 ] , 1 % triton x-100 , 0.1 % sds , 150 mm nacl , 1 mm edta , 1 mm dtt , 1 mm pmsf , with a complete mini-protease inhibitor tablet [ roche , basel , switzerland ] per 10 ml ) .	method
the nacl concentration was raised to 400 mm	method
and the lysate was incubated on ice for 5 min .	method
the nacl concentration was reduced to 200 mm , cell debris was removed by centrifugation , and	method
an equal volume of laemmli buffer was added to the lysate .	method

quantitative rt-pcr analysis was performed	method
to ascertain the expression of ror2 in 293 and l cells .	goal
a specific ror2 transcript in the l cell sample did not emerge until after 40 cycles of amplification ,	result
indicating that ror2 is expressed in almost immeasurably low abundance in l cells .	implication
quantification of the real-time data revealed	result
that ror2 transcripts were over 700 times more abundant in 293 cells than in l cells ( figure 6c ) .	result
mror2 expression thus appears	implication
to be required for wnt5a-mediated inhibition of wnt/beta-catenin signaling in mouse l cells .	implication

as the mechanism	problem
by which ras affects actin filament structures are incompletely understood , it can be only speculated with regard to the function of apkc-lambda or apkc-zeta in this pathway .	problem
the disassembly of actin stress fibers has been correlated to the accumulation of inactive , gdp-charged rhoa ( qui et al. , 1995a , b ) .	fact
activation of rhoa by an exchange of the gdp by a gtp was found	result
to stimulate stress fiber formation ( ridley and hall , 1992 ) .	result
these findings suggest	implication
that the ras-induced disassembly of actin stress fibers is the result of a conversion of the active , gtp-charged rho to the inactive gdp-bound form .	implication
models for a biochemical linkage between the ras and rho proteins have been proposed ( boguski et al. , 1992 ; nobes and hall , 1994 ; chant and stowers , 1995 ) .	hypothesis
in one simple model , the ras/rho pathway includes p120gap , the ras gtpase-activating protein which may also act as a ras effector ( chant and stowers , 1995 ) and p190 , a p120gap-associated protein	hypothesis
which exhibits a rho-specific gtpase-activating domain ( settleman et al. , 1992 ; foster et al. , 1994 ) .	hypothesis
phosphorylation by apkc-lambda and/or apkc-zeta may enhance the activity of p190rho-gap , resulting in an increased conversion of rhogtp	hypothesis
to rhogdp and stress fiber dissolution .	hypothesis
tyrosine phosphorylation of p190 by c-src has been shown	result
to be correlated with egf-induced stress fiber disassembly ( chang et al. , 1995 ) .	result
evidence for a pkc-catalyzed serine/threonine phosphorylation of p190 , however , is still lacking .	problem
alternatively , apkc-lambda and/or apkc-zeta may enhance the rhogdp level by	hypothesis
inhibiting rho-gdi , or exchange factors ( gef ) acting on rho , like smggds , rap1 , dbl , ect2 , and ost ( hiraoka et al. , 1992 ; miki et al. , 1993 ; horii et al. , 1994 ) .	hypothesis
however , models	result
in which the ras-induced disassembly of actin stress fibers are described as resulting exclusively from a ras-mediated conversion of rhogtp to rhogdp are inconsistent with the findings demonstrating an activation of rho by ras as essential for transformation and mitogenesis by oncogenic ras ( prendergast et al. , 1995 ; qui et al. , 1995a , b ; olson et al. , 1998 ) .	result

francisella tularensis , a gram-negative facultative intracellular pathogen infecting principally macrophages and monocytes , is the etiological agent of tularemia .	fact
macrophage responses to f. tularensis infection include the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin ( il ) -12 ,	fact
which is critical for immunity against infection .	fact
molecular mechanisms regulating production of these inflammatory mediators are poorly understood .	fact
herein we report that the sh2 domain-containing inositol phosphatase ( ship ) is phosphorylated upon infection of primary murine macrophages with the genetically related f. novicida	fact
and negatively regulates f. novicida-induced cytokine production .	fact
analyses of the molecular details revealed	method
that in addition to activating the map kinases , f. novicida infection also activated the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( pi3k ) /akt pathway in these cells .	result
interestingly , ship-deficient macrophages displayed enhanced akt activation upon f. novicida infection ,	result
suggesting elevated pi3k-dependent activation pathways in absence of ship .	result
inhibition of pi3k/akt resulted in suppression of f. novicida-induced cytokine production through the inhibition of nfkappab .	result
consistently , macrophages lacking ship displayed enhanced nfkappab-driven gene transcription ,	result
whereas overexpression of ship led to decreased nfkappab activation .	result
thus , we propose	hypothesis
that ship negatively regulates f. novicida-induced inflammatory cytokine response by antagonizing the pi3k/akt pathway and suppressing nfkappab-mediated gene transcription .	hypothesis
a detailed analysis of phosphoinositide signaling may provide valuable clues for	problem
better understanding the pathogenesis of tularemia .	problem

for il-6 mrna detection , ef cells cultured in 100-mm plates were treated with il-1beta or tnf-alpha for 3 h at 37degreesc .	method
total rna was extracted from ef cells with rnazol ( tel-test , inc. , friendswood , tx ) .	method
northern blot analysis was performed as previously described ( 28 ) using a mouse il-6 cdna probe prepared by pcr from commercial mouse il-6 cdna template and oligonucleotides ( clontech , palo alto , ca ) .	method
for detection of secreted il-6 protein , ef ( 5 x 104 /well ) and sf ( 104/well ) cells were incubated overnight in flat-bottomed microtiter plates in 10 % fcs-dmem .	method
after a 2-4-h incubation with low endotoxin 1 % fcs-rpmi-1640 medium ( sigma chemical co. , st. louis , mo ) , cells were treated for 8 h with mouse il-1beta in fresh medium .	method
supernatants were then collected and analyzed for il-6 using commercial elisa kits ( from endogen , inc. , woburn , ma , or genzyme corp. ) , with recombinant mouse il-6 as a standard .	method

the systematic profiling of interaction partners not only allows a global view of interaction sites , but also reveals important detailed information	method
that can be exploited further for the understanding of signaling processes , as will be illustrated with the example of stat5 binding to egfr .	method
stat5 is a transcription factor	fact
that is rapidly activated upon egf stimulation .	fact
it then moves to the nucleus ,	fact
where it is involved in the regulation of gene transcription .	fact
experiments with truncated egfr clones suggested	implication
that the region between tyrosine residue y0978 and y0998 was necessary for activation of stat5 ( xia et al , 2002 ) .	implication
however , it remained unclear	hypothesis
whether this proposed interaction was direct or through a multiprotein complex .	hypothesis
systematic interaction profiling of all tyrosine residues of the erbb-receptor family revealed	result
stat5 as a specific interaction partner to the phosphorylated bait peptides y978 and y998 of the egf receptor and y984 of erbb4 .	result
we confirmed the direct interaction of stat5 and egfr by immunoprecipitation .	result
when egfr was immunoprecipitated from whole-cell lysates of cells under normal growth conditions ( basal stimulation in 10 % fbs )	method
stat5 was identified by western blot and vice versa ( figure 5 ) .	method
to further confirm this finding , we added synthetic phosphorylated peptides py978 and py998 to the immunoprecipitation reaction ,	goal
which resulted in reduced stat5 detection after egfr immunoprecipitation and in reduced egfr detection after stat5 immunoprecipitation .	result
the unphosphorylated counterparts of these peptides had no influence on the immunoprecipitation reactions ( figure 5a ) . figure 5b shows	result
that the interaction of stat5 depended on egfr phosphorylation , which peaked after two minutes of egf stimulation , and that normal growing hela cells also have a basal level of phosphorylated egfr .	result

active ras ( ras-gtp ) triggers a number of signaling cascades , among	fact
which is the one connecting ras to rac , a member of the rho subfamily of small gtpases .	fact
there is evidence	fact
that sos-1 is also active at this step .	fact
first , sos-1 contains a dbl homology domain in tandem with a pleckstrin homology domain , a module responsible for gef activity on rho gtpases ( cerione and zheng , 1996 ; nimnual et al. , 1998 ) .	fact
second , and most importantly , sos-1 has been shown	result
to form a tricomplex in vivo with two signaling molecules , eps8 ( fazioli et al. , 1993 ) and e3b1 ( also known as abi-1 ) ( shi et al. , 1995 ; biesova et al. , 1997 ) .	result
e3b1 contains a sh3 domain and binds sos-1 ( scita et al. , 1999 ; fan and goff , 2000 ) .	result
in addition , e3b1 binds to the sh3 domain of eps8 ( biesova et al. , 1997 ) .	result
thus e3b1 acts as a scaffold protein ,	implication
which holds together sos-1 and eps8 .	implication
the tricomplex sos-1-e3b1-eps8 ( s/e/e8 ) is endowed with rac gef activity in vitro ( scita et al. , 1999 ) .	result
thus , the sum of the above observation raises the possibility	implication
that sos-1 might function at different step in the signaling cascade , acting as a ras-gef and a rac-gef , respectively .	implication
a number of outstanding questions need clarification , however , before such a model could be accepted	problem
does a trimeric s/e/e8 complex exist under physiological conditions ?	problem
how is the specificity of sos-1 directed toward ras or rac ?	problem
does the putative dual function of sos-1 provide a mechanistic framework for the coordinated activation of ras and rac ?	problem
the present studies were undertaken	goal
to elucidate these questions .	goal

confluent cells were lysed in a lysis buffer ( 0.1 % triton x-100 , 50 mm tris-hcl , ph 7.5 , 5 mm edta , 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride , 1 mm benzamidine , 40 mm paranitrophenylphosphate , and 200 mum orthovanadate ) .	method
25 mug of detergent-extracted proteins were separated by sds-page on a 12.5 % ( wt/vol ) polyacrylamide gel ( 30:0 .2 ) and electrophoretically transferred to immobilon-p membrane ( millipore corp. , bedford , ma ) .	method

pgl4.10 vector ( promega , madison wi , usa ) was used for construction of luciferase reporter plasmids .	method
a reporter plasmid ( designated p21up/gl4 ) containing a human p21 promoter region encompassing from -2266 to -1875 was described previously	none
[ 14 ] .	none
the +1 position represents the transcription start site of the downstream promoter .	fact
in this study , we constructed two new luciferase reporter plasmids , p21down/gl4 and p21core/gl4 ,	method
that contain a downstream promoter region from -168 to +66 and a short dna stretch from -5 to +66 of the p21 downstream promoter , respectively .	method
these constructs were generated by a pcr-based strategy using a reporter plasmid	method
encompassing from -2677 to +66 , which has been named p21luc1 as previously described [ 14 ] .	method
primer sets	method
to amplify dna fragments from -168 to +66 and from -5 to +66 sequences were as follows : -168 to +66 forward , 5'-ctcgagggcctgctggaactcggccag ; -5 to +66 forward , 5'-ctcgaggcgccagctgaggtgtgagca ; and common reverse , 5'-agatctcggcgaatccgcgcccagct .	method

in resting human t cells ( as well as in jurkat t cells and in raji b cells ) , pag is expressed as a constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated polypeptide and binds csk in the absence of any stimuli ( fig. 7b and fig. c , and fig. 9 b ) .	result
moreover , immediately after t cell activation , pag becomes dephosphorylated and releases csk ( fig. 9 b ) .	result
together with our observation that pag is an integral plasma membrane protein ( fig. 6 a ) ,	result
these data would be compatible with a model proposing that in resting t cells , the constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated pag targets a fraction of csk to the plasma membrane and thus brings it into proximity with its substrates , the src family kinases .	implication
csk then can phosphorylate the cooh-terminal negative regulatory tyrosine residues , resulting in downregulation of the src kinases enzymatic activity and , as a consequence , suppression of signal transduction .	implication

most recently , major progress has been made in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying translocation of	fact
signaling molecules ( e.g. , phospholipase c gamma1 , slp-76 , etc. ) from the cytosol to the plasma membrane upon t cell activation .	fact
thus , a novel group of transmembrane proteins has been identified	fact
whose cytoplasmic domains contain multiple tyrosine-based signaling motifs that provide docking sites for the sh2 domains of cytosolic effector molecules after phosphorylation by src or syk family ptks .	fact
these molecules have collectively been termed	fact
transmembrane adaptor proteins 47 . until now , three transmembrane adaptor proteins have been identified , namely lat 13 , trim 38 , and shp2-interacting transmembrane adaptor protein 44 .	fact
in this report , we describe identification , purification , nano es ms/ms sequencing , and molecular cloning of a novel transmembrane adaptor protein	method

we previously constructed various kinds of mutant tlps [ 29 ] .	method
among them , n37e and r52e have weakened binding ability to tfiia , and	fact
n37e is a more severe mutant than r52e for tfiia binding , whereas r55e binds to tfiia as strongly as does wild-type tlp .	fact
in this study , we first investigated in	goal
detail the intracellular tfiia-binding strength of these mutants by co-immunoprecipitation assays .	method
it was confirmed	result
that wild-type tlp and r55e exhibited significant binding to tfiia , whereas n37e did not bind to tfiia ( fig. 1 ) .	result
we further investigated processed and unprocessed forms of tfiiaalpha/beta and found	goal
that r52e binds to the alpha and beta subunits of tfiia but does not bind to uncleaved tfiiaalphabeta ( fig. 1 , lane 12 ) .	result

the regulatory influence of ship on f. novicida-induced il-12 , il-6 , and rantes was also observed at different multiplicities of infection ( mois ; figure 2a-2c ) ,	result
suggesting that the negative regulatory effect of ship is independent of bacterial numbers infecting the macrophages .	implication
in addition , the viability of the bacteria is not essential for the negative influence of ship	implication
as macrophages infected with heat-killed bacteria displayed similar cytokine responses as those infected with live bacteria ( figure 2d-2f ) .	result
likewise , ship also down-regulated	result

since little is known of the intracellular localization and requirements of gds proteins to stimulate rho-like gtpases	problem
we analyzed the conditions for tiam1 to stimulate racdependent membrane ruffling and jnk activity .	method
for this , truncated tiam1 proteins , or proteins that contain small deletions in each of the conserved domains , were expressed in fibroblast cells and cos cells , and	method
their intracellular localization and biological activity were analyzed by confocal microscopy , immunoelectron microscopy , and analysis of jnk activity .	method
we demonstrate	implication
that membrane association of tiam1 is absolutely required for rac-dependent induction of membrane ruffling and stimulation of jnk activity .	implication
membrane association of tiam1 is accomplished through the nh2-terminal ph domain , but not the cooh-terminal ph domain or the dhr domain .	result
moreover , ph domain - dependent membrane association of tiam1 could be induced by serum .	result
these results suggest	implication
that the controlled membrane association of tiam1 is an important factor in the activation of distinct rac-mediated signaling pathways .	implication

previously , we demonstrated	result
that tlp , which is one of the tbp family proteins , is involved in regulation of the upstream promoter [ 14 ] .	result
the most attractive property of tlp is its stronger tfiia-binding ability than that of tbp [ 29,30 ] ,	fact
although the functional significance of this property has not been elucidated .	problem
bryant et al. [ 31 ] reported	result
that mutant tbps with decreased tfiia-binding ability showed decreased transcription activation function in vitro .	result
in this study , we demonstrated	result
that asn37 and arg52 of tlp , which correspond to tfiia-reactive asn189 and arg205 of tbp , respectively [ 31 ] , are required for tfiia binding in human cells ( fig. 1 ) .	result
n37e and r52e exhibited decreased transcriptional activation functions for the endogenous upstream promoter ,	result
while r55e , which has substantial tfiia-binding capacity , exhibited native function ( fig. 2c ) .	result
these mutant tlps also exhibited decreased transcriptional activation function for the upstream promoter in an exogenous reporter plasmid ( fig. 2d ) .	result
consequently , tfiia-binding ability of tlp is thought	implication
to be required for tlp-dependent transcriptional activation .	implication
although r52e had binding ability to processed tfiia ( fig. 1 , lane 12 )	result
it exhibited little transcriptional function .	result
because unprocessed tfiia has been reported to be transcriptionally active [ 28 ] , it is possible	result
that binding to unprocessed tfiia is required for tlp function to activate p21 upstream promoter .	hypothesis

based on these results , primary pag immunoprecipitates obtained from lysates of unstimulated or pervanadate-treated hematopoietic cells were analyzed for the presence of the above cytoplasmic	method
signaling molecules .	method
small amounts of fyn ( but not lck ; not shown ) were found in pag immunoprecipitates prepared from unstimulated peripheral blood t cells ( fig. 7 b ) but not jurkat or raji cells ( not shown ) .	result
moreover , fyn and pag also associated with each other	result
when coexpressed in cos cells ( fig. 7 e ) .	result
however , the interaction between fyn and pag seems	result
to be independent from the tyrosine phosphorylation status of pag , as it was not altered after pp1 treatment of the resting t cells ( which caused a strong decrease of pag tyrosine phosphorylation ; fig. 7b ) .	result

mdc1 binds to gammah2ax flanking unrepaired dna dsbs , and then acts as a ' mediator '	fact
to recruit other ddr factors to such sites ( stucki & jackson , 2006 ) .	fact
for example , the atm-phosphorylated tqxf motifs on mdc1 are recognized by the ubiquitin e3 ligase enzyme rnf8 ( huen et al , 2007 ; kolas et al , 2007 ; mailand et al , 2007 ) .	fact
rnf8 then generates ubiquitin adducts on histone h2a -- and possibly other chromatin components	fact
which lead to irif formation by 53bp1 and brca1 ( huen et al , 2007 ; mailand et al , 2007 ) .	fact
this paper describes	implication
how mdc1 facilitates the accumulation and retention of the mrn complex in irif , indicating a new mechanism for mdc1 mediator function .	implication
specifically -- and in contrast to the situation for 53bp1 and brca1 -- our work highlights	implication
how phospho-dependent interactions between mdc1 and mrn might precede the detection and signalling of dna damage .	implication
this characteristic of mdc1-mrn binding might therefore allow this complex	hypothesis
to be efficiently and rapidly recruited to sites of dna damage , thus ensuring that the ddr is launched without delay .	hypothesis
by contrast , the atm - and rnf8-dependent nature of 53bp1 and brca1 recruitment means	implication
that it is likely to happen more slowly , possibly to ensure that the chromatin alterations and other processes triggered by these proteins are invoked only at the right time and in the correct chromatin context .	implication
this model	implication
in which various factors are recruited with different kinetics and factor dependencies -- suggests a more complex , hierarchical and highly regulated ddr than has hitherto been apparent .	implication

many of which are encoded by transforming genes that were identified after transfection of genomic dna or cdna libraries into nih3t3 cells ( cerione and zheng , 1996 ; collard , 1996 ) .	method
a number of these proteins , like dbl , ost , cdc24 , lbc , and vav were shown to activate rho-like gtpases ( hart et al. , 1991 ; horii et al. , 1994 ; zheng et al. , 1994 , 1995 ; olson et al. , 1996 ) .	result
tiam1 is the only gds protein identified	result
that specifically activates rac in vitro as well as in vivo ( michiels et al. , 1995 ) .	result
in fibroblasts , tiam1 induces the formation of membrane ruffles , similarly to constitutively activated v12rac1 ( michiels et al. , 1995 ) .	result
the tiam1-induced phenotype is inhibited by coexpression of dominant-negative mutant ( n17 ) rac1 , but not by coexpression of ( n17 ) cdc42 or by inactivation of rhoa with c3 transferase ( michiels et al. , 1995 ; collard , 1996 ) .	result
this indicates	implication
that the tiam1-induced membrane ruffling is primarily caused by activation of rac and that other rho-like gtpases are not involved .	implication
moreover , v12rac1 , but not v14rhoa , induces an invasive phenotype in	implication
t-lymphoma cells , similar to tiam1 , suggesting that tiam1-induced invasiveness is also caused by activation of rac ( michiels et al. , 1995 ) .	implication

it has previously been demonstrated	result
that substitution of an alanine by a glutamate within the pseudosubstrate domain of pkc isotypes generates ca mutants with reduced cofactor requirements .	result
biochemical and biological properties of these mutants had been described in preceding publications ( baier-bitterlich et al. , 1996 ; uberall et al. , 1997 ; kampfer et al. , 1998 ) .	none

the following mabs were used ( if	method
not stated otherwise , the mabs are products of the authors ' laboratories ) : cd59 ( mem-43 ) , cd18 ( mem-48 ) , cd25 ( aicd25.1 ) ,	result
t cell receptor-interacting molecule ( trim ) -01 , phosphotyrosine ( p-tyr ) -01 and 4g10 , conjugated with horseradish peroxidase ( upstate biotechnology ) , flag ( m2 ; eastman kodak co. ) , myc ( 9e10 , a gift from dr. d. cantrell , imperial cancer research fund , london , uk ) , rabbit antisera to lck and fyn ( provided by dr. a. veillette ) , rabbit antiserum to lat ( provided by dr. l. samelson , national institute of child health and human development , nih , bethesda , md ; reference 13 ) , csk and g-proteins beta subunits ( rabbit abs from santa cruz biotechnology , inc. ) , mitogen-activated protein kinase ( rabbit antiserum from upstate biotechnology ) .	result
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal abs to mouse and rabbit ig were from bio-rad or dianova .	method

however ,	result
when cells were left for 3 h on fibronectin before fixing and staining , the homozygous cells remained well spread , with numerous focal adhesions scattered throughout the ventral surface of the cell ( fig. 3 h ) .	result
surrounding the cells were small , hair-like actin fibers	result
that characterize cells in the early stages of apolar migration ( fig. 3 g ) .	result
the ptp-pest ( +/- ) cells , in contrast , were rounded , with well-defined edges and fewer focal contacts concentrated at the cell periphery ( fig. 3 , e and f ) .	result
the ( -/- ) cells also contained a higher number of stress fibers , a state	result
that is incompatible with cell migration .	implication
a quantitative evaluation of the number of focal adhesions after 3 h ,	method
as counted on vinculin-staining photographs , is shown in fig. 3 i .	method
ptp-pest ( -/- ) cells have , on average , > 85 focal contacts per cell , compared with ~25 in a ( +/- ) cell .	result
thus , the migration defect observed in the wound healing assay above may be in part due to disregulation of focal adhesion assembly and/or disassembly in the ptp-pest cell lines .	implication

it has been confirmed	implication
that the upstream promoter is basically driven by p53 [ 23 ] .	implication
activity of the upstream promoter was almost inert in p53-deficient cells ( fig. 4a ) .	result
moreover , tlp does not exhibit a transcription activation function for the upstream promoter in p53-null cells .	result
we found	result
that the upstream promoter is upregulated by tfiia and is dependent on tfiia in addition to p53 and tlp ( figs 3 and 4 ) .	result
the results shown in figs 5 and 6 demonstrate that these three transcription factors are recruited to the upstream promoter	result
and etoposide , which stimulates p21 gene expression , increased this recruitment .	result
drosophila tlp works	fact
as a cofactor for dref transcription factor of the pcna gene [ 13 ] .	fact
moreover , tfiia can work	fact
as a co-activator of several activators [ 33-36 ] and binds to p53 [ 37 ] .	fact
we have observed intracellular binding of tlp and tfiia [ 29 ] .	result
furthermore , we showed interaction between tlp and p53 [ 25 ] .	result
we therefore speculate that tlp can form a triple complex with tfiia and p53 , and	hypothesis
tlp and tfiia coordinately function as a binary co-activator complex for p53 on the p21 upstream promoter .	hypothesis
the fact	result
that the native , but not n37e , tlp stimulates the upstream promoter additively with tfiia ( fig. 3a-b ) supports this hypothesis .	result

detection of protein-protein interactions has previously been a balance between specificity ( background reduction ) and affinity ( detection of weak interactions ) .	fact
recently , the introduction of stable isotope labeling ,	result
to distinguish specific from unspecific interaction partners ( blagoev et al , 2003 ; ranish et al , 2003 ) , has enabled detection of weak binders in the presence of high levels of background proteins ( see below ) .	method
based on this principle , we have developed a proteomic screen for peptide motif-based interactions ( schulze and mann , 2004 ) .	method
using synthetic peptide pairs in phosphorylated and unphosphorylated form	method
pull-down experiments are performed to enrich specific binding partners to the phosphorylated bait peptides .	method
these proteins are subsequently identified and quantified by mass spectrometry .	method
in this study , by further method development , we greatly increased the throughput of the analysis allowing	method
us to profile the entire phosphotyrosine interactome of the erbb-receptor family .	method

mouse mab-producing hybridoma cells were used as negative control .	method

gtr1 and gtr2 are unique members of the ras gtpase family in yeast22	fact
that have a long c-terminal extension which is required for gtr1/gtr2 heterodimer formation23 , 24 .	fact
in yeast , gtr1/gtr2 act in a multifunctional protein complex involved in nuclear transport regulation , intracellular protein trafficking , microautophagy , and exit from rapamycin-induced growth arrest22 , 24-26 .	fact
raga and ragb are mammalian homologues of gtr1	fact
while ragc and ragd are corresponding homologues of gtr227 , 28 .	fact
although the physiological functions of rag family gtpases are largely unknown , raga and ragb can form heterodimers with ragc and ragd28	fact
and rag complexes may functionally interact with ran to modulate nuclear transport22 , 29 .	fact
here , we identify rag gtpases as novel regulators of torc1 in cultured mammalian cells and drosophila .	hypothesis
our data indicate	implication
that rag promotes cell growth and inhibits autophagy by activating torc1 in response to amino acid signals .	implication

for construction of the double knockout strain pex5/14delta , the pex14 locus was replaced by the loxp-kanmx4-loxp cassette ( guldener et al. , 1996 ) .	method

stimulation of cells by some growth factors like platelet derived growth factor ( pdgf ) , epidermal growth factor ( egf ) , or insulin has been shown	result
to induce a reorganization of actin filaments by mediating actin polymerization at the plasma membrane , where actin filaments form a compact meshwork resulting in the formation of membrane ruffles and lamellipodia ( mellstrom et al. , 1988 ; ridley and hall , 1992 ; rankin and rozengurt , 1994 ) .	result
actin filament organization underlying membrane ruffles appears to be mediated by rac as microinjection of a dn asn-17 rac-1 inhibits pdgf-induced membrane ruffles ,	result
whereas the constitutively active ( ca ) val-12 rac-1 induces membrane ruffling and the formation of focal complexes ( ridley and hall , 1992 ; qiu et al. , 1995a , b ) .	result
evidence for an implication of a lim kinase catalyzed	result
phosphorylation of cofilin in rac-mediated reorganization of actin cytoskeleton has been presented ( arber et al. , 1998 ; yang et al. , 1998 ) .	result
an additional form of actin filament organization is found in microspikes and filopodia	fact
where small bundles of actin filaments are attached to focal complexes at the tips of the filopodia ( nobes and hall , 1995 ) .	fact
actin filament organization in filopodia appears	implication
to be regulated by cdc 42hs ( nobes and hall , 1995 ) .	implication

the protein spot corresponding to pp80 was excised from the silver-stained two-dimensional gel and in-gel digested with trypsin as described 39 .	method
tryptic peptides were extracted from the gel matrix by 5 % formic acid and acetonitrile	method
and extracts were pooled and dried .	method
the sample was redissolved in 5 % formic acid and analyzed by nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry ( nano es ms/ms ) as described 40 .	method
analyses were performed on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer ( api iii ; pe sciex instruments ) equipped with the nanoelectrospray ion source developed at european molecular biology laboratory ( embl 41 ) .	method
acquired tandem mass spectra were interpreted manually	method
using applescript-based software developed at embl .	method

our screen resulted in identification of the vast majority of expected direct interaction partners of the erbb family	result
that bind through phosphotyrosines .	result
among the few exceptions was plc-gamma , which	result
we were unable to find as an interaction partner of y1197 of the egf receptor .	result
this interaction has been described	method
using immunoprecipitations and in vitro phosphopeptide competition and binding assays with cloned domains ( margolis et al , 1990 ; rotin et al , 1992 ) .	method
the peptide-protein interaction assay as such is capable of identifying plc-gamma ,	method
since we previously described such an interaction using an irs4 phosphopeptide as bait ( hinsby et al , 2004 ) .	method
we also could not find the interaction of y1197 with ship1 ( keilhack et al , 1998 ) , or of y1248 of erbb2 with chk ( zrihan-licht et al , 1998 ) .	result
binding constants of sh2 domains to phosphotyrosines are in the range of 50-500 nm ( pawson , 2004 ) ,	result
while binding constants of certain ptb domains to the respective bait peptides can be as low as 2 mum to 10 mum ( yan et al , 2002 ) .	result
the peptide-protein interaction screen was validated for binding constants as low as at least 5 mum ( schulze and mann , 2004 )	method
but it is likely to work with much lower affinity interactions , too .	method
thus , we believe	implication
that the negative results are unlikely to be caused by low affinity of the interactions .	implication
however , some interactions may not only be motif-dependent , but also require cooperative binding or activation of the binding partner .	implication
